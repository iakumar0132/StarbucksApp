        <li>Starbucks was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle's Pike Place Market.</li>
        <li>During the early 1980s, they sold the company to Howard Schultz who—after a business trip to Milan, Italy—decided to convert the coffee bean store into a coffee shop serving espresso-based drinks.</li>
        <li>Starbucks believes in the pursuit of doing good.</li>
        <li>Starbucks' aspiration is to be people-positive, investing in the humanity and well-being of everyone we connect with, from our partners to coffee farmers to the customers in our stores and beyond.</li>
        <li>The Canadian Starbucks story began in Vancouver, BC on March 1, 1987, with the opening of the Seabus Waterfront SkyTrain location.</li>
        <li>Starbucks offers a wide variety of coffee blends and beverages, including Peppermint Mocha, Caramel Latte, and the new Iced Gingerbread Oat Chai.</li>
        <li>We are committed to sustainability and ethical sourcing. Our coffee is sourced through responsible practices, and we aim to reduce our environmental footprint by implementing recycling and eco-friendly initiatives in our stores worldwide.</li>
        <li>Starbucks also offers a range of delicious pastries, sandwiches, and snacks, making it a perfect place for a quick breakfast or a relaxing afternoon break.</li>
